## Security Measures

### Server-Side Protection

1. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs validated with Zod schemas
   - File type restrictions (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
   - File size limits (5MB per photo, 5 photos max)
   - Description length limits (10-500 characters)
   - ZIP code format validation

2. **Injection Prevention**
   - HTML/script tag sanitization
   - SQL parameterization (if database added)
   - No `eval()` or dynamic code execution
   - Content Security Policy headers

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
   - Configurable via environment variables

4. **CORS Protection**
   - Restricted to `https://chatgpt.com`
   - Credentials required for cross-origin requests
   - No wildcard (`*`) origins in production

5. **HTTPS Required**
   - All communications encrypted in transit
   - TLS 1.2+ enforced
   - HSTS headers enabled

6. **API Key Security**
   - OpenAI API key in environment variables only
   - Never exposed in client code or logs
   - Rotated quarterly (recommended)

### Data Protection

1. **PII Redaction**
   - Automatic redaction in logs
   - Sensitive fields (photos, addresses) replaced with `[REDACTED]`
   - No PII in error messages

2. **Access Control**
   - Least-privilege API scopes
   - Vision API read-only access
   - No persistent data access without user consent

3. **Encryption**
   - Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
   - API keys encrypted at rest (platform-managed)
   - No persistent storage of photos (in-memory only)

## User Consent & Control

### Quote Request Confirmation

Contractor outreach requires **explicit user confirmation**:

```javascript
{
  "confirmed": true  // MUST be true, or request fails
}
```

The app will:
1. Show preview of what will be shared
2. List which contractors will receive info
3. Require user to click "Confirm" before proceeding

### Data Deletion

Users can request data deletion:
- **Email**: privacy@yourapp.com
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours
- **Scope**: All stored diagnoses and quote requests

## Safety Gates

### High-Risk Issue Detection

Automatic detection of dangerous repairs:

**Force "Hire Professional" for:**
- ‚ö° Electrical panel work
- üî• Gas line repairs
- üè† Structural/foundation issues
- üèöÔ∏è Roof height work
- ‚ò£Ô∏è Asbestos/mold
- üö∞ Main water/sewer lines

When detected:
- DIY option **disabled**
- Safety warning displayed
- Only "Get Quotes" action shown

### User Confirmation Required

The following actions need user approval:
- Contacting contractors
- Sharing ZIP code/scope
- Exporting personal data

## Third-Party Services

### OpenAI API

- **Purpose**: Vision analysis, plan/BOM generation
- **Data shared**: Photos, descriptions
- **Retention**: Per OpenAI's 30-day policy
- **Privacy policy**: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

### Contractor Platforms (Future Integration)

Potential integrations:
- HomeAdvisor
